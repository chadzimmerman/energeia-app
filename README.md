Energe.ia
Energe.ia is a gamified habit-tracking application that transforms personal growth into a medieval, retro-styled RPG adventure. Heavily influenced by Eastern Palamite mysticism and medieval aesthetics, the app serves as a "cozy" digital sanctuary for those seeking to cultivate virtue and excise vice.

⚔️ The Concept: Growth Through "Energeia"
In this system, your character is a direct reflection of your real-world choices. The core mechanic revolves around the concept of Energeia—the actualization of potential.

Virtue & Vice: Gain Energeia by completing positive habits or successfully rejecting negative ones. Conversely, falling back into bad habits causes your character to lose HP.

RPG Progression: Start by choosing from 3 unique starter classes. As you develop your real-life discipline, your character grows in power, unlocking the ability to purchase armor, weapons, and items from the Market.

Aesthetic: A retro, "low-fi" cozy vibe that encourages a peaceful but disciplined state of mind.

🛠️ Technical Stack
Frontend: React Native with Tailwind CSS (NativeWind) for a highly responsive, custom-styled UI.

Backend: PostgreSQL for robust, relational data modeling of user habits, character stats, and item inventories.

State Management: Secure multi-user authentication with role-based access control.

Monetization (Upcoming): Stripe API integration for subscription models (unlocking premium classes, seasonal gear, and expanded aesthetics).

📊 Behavioral Analytics & CBT
Energe.ia isn't just a game; it's a tool for self-mastery and clinical insight:

Trend Analysis: A detailed calendar tracks streaks and progress across daily, weekly, and monthly intervals.

Trigger Identification: Analyze data trends to determine environmental or emotional triggers for negative habits.

Clinical Integration: Designed to be used alongside therapy or spiritual counseling, utilizing Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) principles to replace bad habits with positive exercises.
