**Energe.ia** is a gamified habit-tracking application that transforms personal growth into a medieval, retro-styled RPG adventure. Heavily influenced by Eastern Palamite mysticism and medieval aesthetics, the app serves as a "cozy" digital sanctuary for those seeking to cultivate virtue and excise vice.

## ⚔️ The Concept: Growth Through "Energeia"

In this system, your character is a direct reflection of your real-world choices. The core mechanic revolves around the concept of _Energeia_—the actualization of potential.

- **Virtue & Vice**: Gain Energeia by completing positive habits or successfully rejecting negative ones. Conversely, failing back into bad habits causes your character to lose HP.
- **RPG Progression**: Start by choosing from 3 unique starter classes. As you develop your real-life discipline, your character grows in power, unlocking the ability to purchase armor, weapons, and items from the **Market**.
- **Aesthetic**: A retro, "low-fi" cozy vibe that encourages a peaceful but disciplined state of mind.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Frontend:** React Native with Tailwind CSS (NativeWind) for a highly responsive, custom-styled UI.
- **Backend & Database:** **Supabase (PostgreSQL)** managing real-time data persistence, relational mapping, and secure storage.
- **Deployment:** **Vercel** for automated CI/CD pipelines and backend service management.
- **Authentication:** Multi-user authentication flows with role-based access control.
- **Monetization (Upcoming):** Stripe API integration for subscription models (unlocking premium classes, seasonal gear, and expanded aesthetics).

## 📊 Behavioral Analytics & CBT

Energe.ia isn't just a game; it's a tool for self-mastery and clinical insight:

- **Trend Analysis:** A detailed calendar tracks streaks and progress across daily, weekly, and monthly intervals.
- **Trigger Identification:** Analyze data trends to determine environmental or emotional triggers for negative habits.
- **Clinical Integration:** Designed to be used alongside therapy or spiritual counseling, utilizing Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) principles to replace bad habits with positive exercises.
